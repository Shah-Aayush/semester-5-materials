Consider the following subnetted Class A network: 10.0.0.0 255.255.248.0
How many new networks were created?
How many usable hosts are there per network?
What is the full range of the first three networks?

By default, the 10.0.0.0 network has a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0. To
determine the number of bits stolen:
255.0.0.0: 		11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
255.255.248.0: 	11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000
Clearly, 13 bits have been stolen to create the new subnet mask. To calculate
the total number of new networks:
2^n = 2^13 = 8192 new networks created
There are clearly 11 bits remaining in the host portion of the mask:
2^n – 2 = 2^11 – 2 = 2048 – 2 = 2046 usable hosts per network
Calculating the ranges is a bit tricky. Using the shortcut method, subtract the
third octet (248) of the subnet mask (255.255.248.0) from 256.
256 – 248 = 8
The first network will begin at 0, again. However, the ranges are spread across multiple octets. The ranges of the first three networks look as follows:
Subnet address 		10.0.0.0 		10.0.8.0 		10.0.16.0
					10.0.0.1		10.0.8.1		10.0.16.1
				
Usable Range

					10.0.7.254		10.0.15.254		10.0.23.254
Broadcast address 	10.0.7.255 		10.0.15.255 	10.0.23.255
