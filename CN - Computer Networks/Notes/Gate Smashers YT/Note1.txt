Syllabus :

	Physical layer - Cables, Topology, Transmission modes, Encoding,  LAN Devices, Modulation
	Data link - Stop & wait, Go back and Selective Repeat, MAC Protocols, Switching Error Control, Ethernet frame format
	Network - IP addressing, Routing Protocols, IPV4 header, IPV6 header
	Transport - TCP, UDP, Headers
	Session
	Presentation
	Application
	Network Security
	
	All syllabus is depended on OSI's 7 layers.
	
Computer Network
	
	Sender  -->  Receiver
		 connection
		
	- protocol : set of instructions.
	- proper communications is happened when there is protocol at both sender and receiver machines.
	- Client and servers are present on different machines then there will be Computer Networks concept.
	
	> Functionalities : 
		1. Mandatory
			Error control : Accuracy of data
			Flow control : Amount of data; there should be some kind of limitations;
			Multiplexing & Demultiplexing : Multiple processes and their data segregation		ETC.
			
		2. Optional
			Encryption & Decryption : Cryptography
				- this increases complexity!
			Check point : When downloading data, at some point there should be a checkpoint in between.
				- not required for small data like whats-app chats.		ETC.
			
		>> OSI model defines all these functionalities into one concrete bundle.
			Open System Interconnection :
				Application layer
				Presentation layer
				Session layer
				Transport layer
				Network layer
				Data link layer
				Physical layer
			
			
TCP/IP protocol suite : 

	TCP/IP protocol suite or Internet protocol
	Developed by ARPANET
	Support client-server 	//one server serves many clients
	and 
	peer to peer			//distributed way data transfer

Physical layer  and its functionalities : [sender:LAST; receiver:FIRST]
	
	Cables and connections	(UTP,RTG etc. type connectors)
	Physical topology		(Star, mesh, bus topology configuration)
	Hardwares (Repeaters: If noise interrupted	or signal attenuation happended and we have to gain original level then this will be used., Hubs:used for multi point connections.)
	Transmission mode	(Simplex transmission (tv type), half duplex, full duplex)
	Multiplexing		(Channel used : wire or wireless; dividing frequency to send multiple signals simultaneously. no collision, time division and wave division.)
	Encoding			(different types of encoding. analog to digital or digital to analog)
	
	>bits form data converted into signals here!	|| SENDER SIDE
	>signals converted into bits here!				|| RECEIVER SIDE
	
	
Topology
	
	Mesh
		All devices are connected with each other.
		no of cables	=> nC2		where n = number of nodes
		no of ports		=> 	n-1	on each device		{wires when device connects; TOTAL PORTS : n*(n-1)}
		Reliability		=>	HIGH					{If any failure  happens then will system stop? no here multiple options are present. so there is more reliability than any other topology}
		Cost			=> 	HIGH					{depends uppon cables}
		Security		=> HIGH						{one node can communicate with another directly so there is more security}
		
		Maintenance will be high.
		It supports point to point communication or dedicated communication.
		
	Star
		no of cables	=> n		where n = number of nodes
		no of ports		=> 	1	on each device		{wires when device connects; TOTAL PORTS : n}
		Reliability		=>	NONE					{If there is failure in hub then communication b/w all the nodes will be stopped}
		Cost			=> 	NORMAL					{lower than MESH}
		Security		=> LESS						{Can be manually applied but ususally by default there is no security}
		
		Star has one centralized multi-port device.
		It supports point to point communication or dedicated communication.
