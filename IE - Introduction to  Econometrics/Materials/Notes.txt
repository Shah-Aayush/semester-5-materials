METHODOLOGY OF ECONOMETRICS

Broadly speaking, traditional econometric methodology proceeds along
the following steps:

1. Statement of theory or hypothesis.
2. Specification of the mathematical model of the theory
3. Specification of the statistical, or econometric, model
4. Obtaining the data
5. Estimation of the parameters of the econometric model
6. Hypothesis testing
7. Forecasting or prediction
8. Using the model for control or policy purposes
