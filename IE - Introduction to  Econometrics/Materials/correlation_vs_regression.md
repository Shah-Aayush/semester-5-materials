Difference between correlation and regression
Correlation | Regression
1. Nature of Relationship : 
	- Tests  the closeness of  variables
	- Measures the extent of change in dependent variable y due to  change in independent variable X.
2. Relationship
	- Only closeness of variables is studied. it does not study cause and effect relationship between variables.
	- Cause and effect relationship in  variables moving in same or opposite direction is studied
3. Mutual dependence of variables
	- Studies mutual dependence of variables
	- In regression analysis the functional relationship showing dependence of one variable upon other is analyzed
4. Spurious correlation
	- chances of spurious correlation b/w two  variables having  no  practical  importance may be observed.
	- There is no chance of existence of such type of relation in regression analysis.
5. Mathematical treatment 
	- no scope for further mathematical treatment
	- can be used for further mathematical treatment
6. Origin and scale
	- is independent of change of origin as well as change of scale.
	- is independent of change of origin but not of change of scale.
7. relative and absolute measures
	- it is a relative measure of linear relationship between x and y and is independent of measurement. it is a number which  lies from +1 to -1.
	- it is an  absolute measure showing the change in the value of y or x  for  unit change in value of x or y.
8. Applicability
	- It has very limited scope of application.  it is limited to linear relationship between two variable.
	- scope of applicability is very wide. It can be covered under linear as well as non linear relationship b/w variables.
9. Differentiation in variables
	- Both variables are considered at per study purpose
	- Variables are differentiated as dependent and independent variables.
10. Symmetrical or asymmetrical formation
	- correlation is symmetrical in formation
		- rxy = ryx
		- r is a both way relationship of x on y or y on x.
	- the approach is treating one variable as dependent and other as independent  thus  making  analysis asymmetrical  i.e. 
		-  byx != bxy
