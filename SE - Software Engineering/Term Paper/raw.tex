\textbf{\emph{Abstract}}
  \textbf{The solution to the challenge of cross-platform development for today's developers is described in this paper. It goes over why we need cross-platform development, the benefits, drawbacks, and problems of doing so, as well as the pros, cons, and verdict for a few cross-platform development tools so you can figure out which one to use for which application.}

\section{Introduction}

The activity of building software products or services for several platforms or software environments is known as cross-platform development. It is a method for generating programming products or administrations that can be used in a variety of stages or programming situations. Designers and developers use a variety of techniques to teach distinct working frameworks and climates for a single application.

Cross-platform development is based on the idea that a product or software application should be able to work well in multiple digital environments. This is done in order to market programming for more than one restricted functioning framework stage, such as to compel use on both Microsoft and Apple platforms, or Android, Blackberry, and iOS. Cross-platform programming is growing, rising, and vital to study and use with the expansion of mobile technology and the investigation of open-source advancements like Linux.\cite{hackernoon}

The following are the key goals of this review paper:

\begin{itemize}
%   \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.0}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}  
  \item Becoming acquainted with the notion of cross-platform development tools
  \item The difference between cross-platform and native development tools
  \item Choosing the best tool for the required task
  \item The benefits and drawbacks of using cross-platform development tools
  \item Issues with cross-platform development tools
\end{itemize}

\section{Differences between Native and Cross-Platform development}

Native vs. cross development is very hot debate
and tech community has not still come to conclusion. Some
are the in favors of native app whereas some support cross-platform development.Both native and cross-platform app
development technology are in a steady kingdom of
evolution. This converting nature of technology indicators
that those subjects must be revisited and then to test which
of those alternatives is presently main the game.

The difference between native and cross-platform
development app is given below: 
\begin{longtblr}[
  caption = {Native and Cross-platform app comparison},
  label = {tab:test},
]{
  colspec = {|XX[1]|},
%   rowhead = 1,
  hlines,
} 

\textbf{Native Apps}& \textbf{Cross-platform apps}\\
It involves high cost for development & It includes lesser amount of cost for development  \\
It codes on a single platform  & It codes on a multiple platform, which is easy to use\\
Without any traffic, Platform SDK able to access to device’s API & Not able to access all the device’s API’s  \\
Consistent with the UI components of the device.& It has lower consistency with the UI Components  \\
Flawless performance, when theapp is developed for the devices OS & It has high performance however lags and hardware compatibility problems are common\\
\end{longtblr}


\section{Selecting the most appropriate tool}

With so many options to consider, it may be difficult to narrow down which ones are the finest.\par
When making a decision, the four primary elements listed below should be taken into account.

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}  
  \item Speed Considerations
  \item Feature Support
  \item Framework Risk
  \item Development Cost
\end{itemize}

For cross-platform development tools, analyzing these elements is very crucial.
